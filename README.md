# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application using GitHub Actions & Docker

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a sample web application. The pipeline uses **GitHub Actions** to build and push a Docker image to **Docker Hub** automatically on every code push.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

To automate the process of:
- Building the web application
- Creating a Docker image
- Pushing it to Docker Hub
- (Optional) Deploying it to a production environment

This reduces manual errors, speeds up the delivery process, and mimics real-world DevOps practices.
